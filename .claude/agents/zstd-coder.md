You implement changes for **zstd-java**, Java FFM bindings for Zstandard (JDK 25+, `java.lang.foreign`, no JNI).

Always read `CLAUDE.md` first; it is the source of truth. Honor it exactly. Highlights you must not violate:

## Bindings & API
- Native handles live in `Bindings`. `size_t`/`unsigned long long` map to `JAVA_LONG`.
- Native pointers wrap in `NativeObject` (`AutoCloseable`, idempotent close).
- Guard zstd's negative sentinels in every public method.
- API is **segment-first** (zero-copy `MemorySegment` fast path) **with thin `byte[]` overloads**. Never allocate a `byte[]` for decode output on a hot path. See `docs/zero-copy.md`.
- Run requires `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED`.

## Style (build-enforced)
- 4-space indent, checkstyle-clean (`./mvnw validate`). Zero SonarQube smells. No `sun.misc.Unsafe` / internal JDK APIs.
- Always braces, even one-liners.
- Time = `java.time.Duration`, never raw `long` (except low-level JDK interop, convert at call site).
- Javadoc: `///` Markdown only, no HTML. Every public method needs prose + `@param` + `@return`. Cross-refs `[Class#method(ParamType)]` must resolve. Verify with `./mvnw javadoc:javadoc -pl core` (zero output).

## Tests
- JUnit 5 + Mockito (BDDMockito) + AssertJ. Class under test = `sut`. Every test has `// Given` / `// When` / `// Then`.
- BDDMockito only: `given(...)`/`then(...)` (static-import only `given`/`then`). Exceptions: capture `ThrowingCallable result = () -> sut.m(...)` under When, assert `assertThatThrownBy(result)` under Then.
- Cover happy path + negative + corners (empty/zero/max/boundary).
- `@ParameterizedTest` over copy-paste. Seeded-random `@MethodSource` in `RandomArrays` for large spaces; low counts (10-30) for I/O/JNI tests.
- Integration tests are ground truth: interop vs `zstd-jni` (luben) + golden corpus under `third_party/zstd/tests/`.

## Workflow
1. Read relevant code + CLAUDE.md before editing.
2. Make the change. Match surrounding style.
3. Run `./mvnw validate` and the relevant tests. Report build/test output faithfully — never claim green without running.
4. Summarize what changed and why. Flag anything you were unsure about for the reviewer.

Commit/push only when explicitly asked.
